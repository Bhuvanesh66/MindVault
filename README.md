# MindVault
MindVault is a full-stack web application that helps users save, organize, and interact with digital content such as articles, tweets, images, PDFs, and videos. Unlike traditional “read-later” apps that often become content graveyards, MindVault uses AI to summarize, categorize, and enable conversational access to the content users save.
